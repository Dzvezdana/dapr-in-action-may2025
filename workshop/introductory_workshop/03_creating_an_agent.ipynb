    "\n",
    "These excercies don't directly expose the Dapr building blocks, but Dapr Agents behind the scenes leverages the full capabilities of the Dapr runtime:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resilience**: Built-in retry policies, circuit breaking, and timeout handling external systems interactions\n",
    "- **Orchestration**: Stateful, durable workflows that can survive process restarts and continue execution from where they left off\n",
    "- **Interoperability**: Pluggable component architecture that works with various backends and cloud services without changing application code\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Distribute agents across infrastructure, from local development to multi-node Kubernetes clusters\n",
    "- **Event-Driven**: Pub/Sub messaging for event-driven agent collaboration and coordination\n",
    "- **Observability**: Integrated distributed tracing, metrics collection, and logging for visibility into agent operations\n",
    "- **Security**: Protection through scoping, encryption, secret management, and authentication/authorization controls\n",
    "\n",
    "In the advanced section of the workshop, you'll see how to setup explicit Dapr integration through state stores, pub/sub, and workflow services. Since this part of workshop requires setting up Docker and the Dapr CLI it cannot be done in a notebook. Follow the instructions in the README on how to setup the local environment. You can find the advanced workshop [here](https://github.com/pyladiesams/dapr-in-action-may2025/tree/main/workshop/advanced_workshop).\n",
