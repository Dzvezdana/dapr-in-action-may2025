    "### What are AI Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents are systems that understand tasks, make decisions, and take actions autonomously. They use large language models (LLMs) as their \"brain\" for reasoning and planning, while leveraging external tools like APIs to access real-time information and interact with the world. Their behavior is non-deterministicâ€”they may respond differently to the same input because LLMs can generate varied outputs, and the information they retrieve through tools may change depending on when or how they access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use AI Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open-ended problems: allowing the LLM to determine needed steps to complete a task because it can't always be hardcoded into a workflow.\n",
    "* Multi-step processes: tasks that require a level of complexity in which the AI Agent needs to use tools or information over multiple turns instead of single shot retrieval.\n",
    "* Improvement over time: tasks where the agent can improve over time by receiving feedback from either its environment or users in order to provide better utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing between an LLMs or an API\n",
    "\n",
    "Use an LLM when you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explanations, general knowledge, or educational content.\n",
    "* Creative writing, content generation, or brainstorming.\n",
    "* Conversational interactions, personal assistance, or reminders.\n",
    "* NLP tasks like summarization, sentiment analysis, and translations\n",
    "\n",
    "Use an API when you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Real-time or up-to-date information (e.g., stock prices, weather).\n",
    "* Structured, specific data (e.g., country statistics, flight info).\n",
    "* Access to external services (e.g., payment processing, user authentication).\n",

He developed his own racing team, perhaps looking to extend his athletic endeavors and leverage his fame and public interest in the sports. This move shows Jacksonâ€™s ambition and drive to explore new ventures, engage with fans on different fronts, and possibly capitalize on his name recognition in a sister sport.\\n\\n2. The Echoes of a Remarkable Strategy in Stock Market Terms â€“ Manishi Raychaudhuri\\'s Analogy: Manishi Raychaudhuri, presumably an expert on market dynamics or investment strategies, characterizes the intermittent slow down in market momentum as a \"Nifty Pause.\" According to his view, this cautious approach indicates that the market might be testing the waters before potentially scaling new heights. Such an interpretation suggests market participants are perhaps waiting to assess investment opportunities and potential economic indicators with careful consideration, following any recent market fluctuations.\\n\\nThese news items reflect activities in different yet financially and publicly significant domainsâ€”Lamar Jacksonâ€™s transition into horse racing and Raychaudhuriâ€™s explanation of market behavior. Each conveys a snapshot of multifaceted engagement from individuals and analysts who influence or respond to their respective fields\\' trends and dynamics.'"
